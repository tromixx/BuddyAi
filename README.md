Here's your cleaned-up README.md with a clear roadmap:

# AI Documentation Buddy (MVP)

## Tech Stack
| Component          | Technology               | Purpose                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Frontend           | Blazor Server            | No separate API needed           |
| UI Library         | MudBlazor                | Professional UI components       |
| LLM                | Groq's Llama 3 70B API   | Free, no-GPU AI responses        |
| Document Storage   | In-memory (Dictionary)   | Simple key-value storage         |

## Quick Start
1. **Setup**:
```bash
dotnet new blazorserver -n AIDocBuddy
cd AIDocBuddy
dotnet add package MudBlazor
```

2. **Run**:
```bash
dotnet run
```

3. **Access**: `https://localhost:7222`

## Core Features
- 3D animated robot assistant
- Chat interface with typing indicators
- Jira documentation lookup (simulated)
- Groq API integration for AI responses

```csharp
// Sample Jira doc lookup
var response = JiraSimulator.Search("password reset");
// Returns: "Go to Settings > Security"
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Improvements
1. **UI Enhancements**
   - [ ] Add password login screen
   - [ ] Implement responsive mobile layout
   - [ ] Add dark/light mode toggle

2. **Chat Upgrades**
   - [ ] Save conversation history
   - [ ] Add markdown support
   - [ ] Implement typing animations

3. **Security**
   - [ ] Add basic password protection
   - [ ] Implement IP whitelisting
   - [ ] Add rate limiting

### Phase 2 (Production Ready)
1. **Jira Integration**
   - [ ] Real API connection
   - [ ] OAuth authentication
   - [ ] Document versioning

2. **AI Improvements**
   - [ ] RAG with ChromaDB
   - [ ] Fine-tuned prompts
   - [ ] Multi-document synthesis

3. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Docker containerization
   - [ ] Azure App Service setup
   - [ ] CI/CD pipeline

## Demo Flow
1. User asks: "How to fix login?"
2. System:
   - Finds relevant Jira doc snippet
   - Generates AI response using context
3. Displays: "According to DOC-123: Use SSO portal"

> **Note**: MVP uses simulated data - see "Next Steps" for production upgrades

Key improvements:
1. Organized into clear sections
2. Added proper code formatting
3. Created actionable next steps grouped by priority
4. Maintained all technical details while being more scannable
5. Added visual hierarchy with markdown
6. Included both immediate and long-term goals

Would you like me to:
1. Add specific implementation details for any section?
2. Include screenshots of the current UI?
3. Expand the deployment instructions?
